[2022-01-12 10:00] Problem with python venv
@python @pip

I have problem with creating venv with following error

`Error: Command '['.../bin/python3.9', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`


Looks like it debian/ubuntu problem 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847


To solve it create venv with ` --clear --without-pip `

`python3.9 -m venv --clear --without-pip my-vene`


I don't understand it, right now I have pip from my other python3.6
According to documentation 

`https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html`

`Skips installing or upgrading pip in the virtual environment (pip is bootstrapped by default)`

And one more thing it calls ensurepip when this option is not provided

`Unless the --without-pip option is given, ensurepip will be invoked to bootstrap pip into the virtual environment.`

@pandas @groupby

To get list from not grouped column You need to use `apply` and `list` with selected column to aggregate
```
aaaa = df.groupby(['tag_id'])['col2'].apply(list)
```

Full example

```
d = {'tag_id': [222, 222, 3333,3333], 'col2': ['abc', 'cde', 'xxxxx', 'yyyyy']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
aaaa = df.groupby(['tag_id'])['col2'].apply(list)
```

Output
```
tag_id
222         [abc, cde]
3333    [xxxxx, yyyyy]
```

[2022-02-08 13:46] [2022-02-08 13:44] Postgres inner loop with LATERAL
@postgresql

In postgrsql we have nice feature. We can use inner loops

```
for x in xxx:
        for y in yyy:
                -- we can do someting like this
```

For example can convert row to rows

col1 col2 col3
aa   bb   cc

we can transfer into

col1 aa
col2 bb
col3 cc


```
select key, value from table c, lateral json_each(row_to_json(c))
```

[2022-02-18 17:32] Python ABC class
@python

This class is to check wheter dervived class during creation has all metohd implemented
It's in beetwen static language and dynaminc laguage type check

Normali we would get exeption during calling method that given object doen't have it
It maye be that this metod will be called in some situations and not catched in production
Creating object generaly are before calling metohds :) so we shold see error earlier
