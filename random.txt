[2022-01-12 10:00] Problem with python venv
@python @pip

I have problem with creating venv with following error

`Error: Command '['.../bin/python3.9', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.`


Looks like it debian/ubuntu problem 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847


To solve it create venv with ` --clear --without-pip `

`python3.9 -m venv --clear --without-pip my-vene`


I don't understand it, right now I have pip from my other python3.6
According to documentation 

`https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html`

`Skips installing or upgrading pip in the virtual environment (pip is bootstrapped by default)`

And one more thing it calls ensurepip when this option is not provided

`Unless the --without-pip option is given, ensurepip will be invoked to bootstrap pip into the virtual environment.`
